The scheme (operated hitherto as Special Scheme for NER) provides financial assistance to institutions located in the North East Region for solving water problems in the campus, providing alternative power support and high-speed internet connectivity. This will significantly address the infrastructural problems confronted by students on day to day basis. The Scheme is being implemented through the Indian Institute of Technology– Guwahati.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nb. North East India largely has hilly regions where the supply of water is not regular throughout the year and during the dry season, there is no secured water supply in the institutes. Water harvesting projects are supported under the Scheme for assured water even during the dry season.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nc. Most of the urban and rural areas in North Eastern India are deprived of continuous electricity supply, which not only affects daily life but also imparting of higher technical education. The scheme makes the provision of installations for captive solar power energy; at places where the solar energy is not effective, procurement of generators can be considered. Such support will make the technical institutes function better by meeting the shortage of conventional electricity supply:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nd. The availability/ connection of the internet facility is also not up to the desired level in North Eastern Region. To mitigate this problem, funding \r\nfor setting up an initial internet connection is considered under the Scheme.

            "details": "Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is the flagship program of the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) for promoting poverty reduction through building strong institutions for the poor, particularly women, and enabling these institutions to access a range of financial services and livelihoods. DAY-NRLM adopts a demand-driven approach, enabling the States to formulate their own State-specific poverty reduction action plans. The blocks and districts in which all the components of DAY-NRLM would be implemented, either through the SRLMs or partner institutions or NGOs, would be the intensive blocks and districts, whereas the remaining would be non-intensive blocks and districts. National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is a restructured version of restructuring Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY). NRLM was renamed as DAY-NRLM (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission) w.e.f. March 29, 2016. \r\n<br>\r\n\r\nNRLM has set out with an agenda to cover 7 Crore rural poor households, across 600 districts, 6000 blocks, 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats and 6 lakh villages in the country through self-managed Self Help Groups (SHGs) and federated institutions and support them for livelihoods collectives in a period of 8-10 years. In addition, the poor would be facilitated to achieve increased access to their rights, entitlements, and public services, diversified risk, and better social indicators of empowerment. NRLM believes in harnessing the innate capabilities of the poor and complements them with capacities (information, knowledge, skills, tools, finance, and collectivization) to participate in the growing economy of the country.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n> **The Mission**\r\n\r\n&quot;To reduce poverty by enabling the poor households to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities, resulting in appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong grassroots institutions of the poor.&quot;\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n> **The Core Values**\r\n\r\nInclusion of the poorest, and meaningful role to the poorest in all the processes\r\nTransparency and accountability of all processes and institutions\r\nOwnership and the key role of the poor and their institutions in all stages – planning, implementation, and, monitoring\r\nCommunity self-reliance and self-dependence\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nNRLM implementation is in a Mission Mode. This enables - \r\n(a) the shift from the present allocation-based strategy to a demand-driven strategy enabling the states to formulate their own livelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans, \r\n(b) focus on targets, outcomes, and time-bound delivery, \r\n(c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector, and \r\n(d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes. \r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAs NRLM follows a demand-driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction. The overall plans would be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios.",

Enable Poor and Marginalized to Access Benefits - Demand led skill training at no cost to the rural poor\r\n1. Inclusive Program Design - Mandatory coverage of socially disadvantaged groups (SC/ST 50%; Minority 15%; Women 33%)\r\n1. Shifting Emphasis from Training to Career Progression - Pioneers in providing incentives for job retention, career progression and foreign placements\r\n1. Greater Support for Placed Candidates - Post-placement support, migration support and alumni network\r\n1. Proactive Approach to Build Placement Partnerships - Guaranteed Placement for at least 75% trained candidates\r\n1. Enhancing the Capacity of Implementation Partners- Nurturing new training service providers and developing their skills\r\n1. Regional Focus - Greater emphasis on projects for poor rural youth in Jammu and Kashmir (HIMAYAT), The North-East region and 27 Left-Wing Extremist (LWE) districts (ROSHINI)\r\n1. Standards-led Delivery - All program activities are subject to Standard Operating Procedures that are not open to interpretation by local inspectors. All inspections are supported by geo-tagged, time stamped videos/photographs",
            "eligibility": "## Rural youth who are poor\r\nThe target group for DDU-GKY are poor rural youth in the age group 15-35. However, the upper age limit for women candidates, and candidates belonging to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), Transgender and other Special Groups like rehabilitated bonded labour, victims of trafficking, manual scavengers, trans-genders, HIV positive persons, etc shall be 45 years.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe poor will be identified by a process called Participatory Identification of Poor (PIP) which is an important component of the NRLM strategy. Till the time, the poor are identified through the use of PIP, apart from the existing list of Below Poverty Line (BPL) households, youth from MGNREGA worker households with at least 15 days of work in the previous financial year by any of its family members, or youth from a household with RSBY card wherein the details of youth is mentioned in the card or youth from households who have been issued, Antyodaya Anna\r\nYojana / BPL PDS cards, or youth from a household where a family member is a member of SHG under NRLM, or youth from a household covered under auto inclusion parameters as per SECC, 2011 (when notified), shall also be eligible to avail the skilling program even if such youth are not in the BPL list. It is expected that they will be identified during the PIP.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## Focus on SC/ST, minorities and women\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAt the national level, 50% of the funds would be earmarked for SCs and STs with the proportion between SCs and STs being decided from time to time by the MoRD. A further 15% of the funds would be set apart for beneficiaries from among minority groups. States should also ensure that at least 3% of beneficiaries are from among persons with disabilities. One-third of the persons covered should be women. This earmarking is only the minimum. However, targets from SC and ST can be interchanged if there are no eligible beneficiaries from either of\r\nthe category and it is certified as such by the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA). \r\n<br>\r\n\r\nIn the case of people with disabilities, separate projects have to be submitted. These projects will have separate training centers and the unit costs will be different from those mentioned in these guidelines. \r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## Special groups \r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThough there are no separate targets for special groups such as PWD, victims of trafficking, manual scavengers, trans-gender, rehabilitated bonded labor, and other vulnerable groups, States have to develop strategies that address issues of access of special groups who usually get left out. The nature of affirmative action that is required to overcome their challenges and barriers to participation need to be incorporated into the skill action plan proposed by the State. In the case of those with hearing and speech impairment, locomotor and visual impairment it will also be necessary to sensitize prospective employers to ensure they get job placements.
